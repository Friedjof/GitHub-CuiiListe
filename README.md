# CUII Blocklists
## Introduction
This repository is a mirror of https://cuiiliste.de/domains

If you cannot access the blocklist because the site is blocked, you can use this list.
The blocked domains point to an IP. You can add this IP to the hosts file or manually add it to your [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) or [AdGuard Home](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html).

> More about bypassing the blocks on this [website](https://cuiiliste.de/umgehen).

> This list is automatically updated every 30 minutes with the `update.py` script directly from the [above website](https://cuiiliste.de/domains).

If you want to adjust the hosts file on your system, you can check out another project of mine that makes the changes super easy on Linux: [Hosts-Manager](https://github.com/Friedjof/hosts)
Also installable via pipx (See also [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/hosts-manager/)):
```bash
pip install hosts-manager
```

## GitHub as an API
